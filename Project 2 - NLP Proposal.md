# Group1_Project2

## Overview
We propose to a project wherein we utilize Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis to determine the sentiment of news articles in the United States and Europe (or overseas Places) for specific stocks or cryptocurrencies.

  We will then compare sentiment to percent change of stock on a daily basis to determine how sentiment affects price change.  We want to utilize this data to build a predictive model(s) (determine which predictive model(s)) to predict whether you should sell, buy, or hold the stock. We will attempt to create a trading algorithm to evaluate our methods if time allows.

## Data Sources:
1. Possible Screen/Data Scape of Market Watch Headlines
2. API (NLTK, NEWS API, etc)

##  NLP Planning/Next Steps:
1. Pull 1 yearâ€™s worth of news articles & analyze sentiment(12.2 Vader Sentiment)
2. Correlate to daily returns data (12.3 Correlating Returns)
3. Machine Learning Models:
Use sentiment scores as variables and closing prices / daily returns as target
4. Binomial Classification (up or down)
5. Multinomial Classification (percentiles as classes)
6. Evaluate using a **New Model**
7. *Not in MVP*- Algorithmic Trading
